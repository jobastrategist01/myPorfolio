# Welcome to My Capstone Project: Collectible Card Market Analysis

Thank you for visiting my Capstone Project! This project focuses on The research and analysis to help a Canadian company thought data and all the knowledge gathered during my studies.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding consumer preferences and behaviors to help a Canadian collectible card company develop new products. Through qualitative research (focus groups) and quantitative research (virtual surveys), the study identifies key trends, emotional triggers, and purchasing motivations. It also develops a predictive model to classify individuals as collectors or non-collectors. The project involves:

- **Research Methodologies**: Applying Qualitative & Quantitative methodologies to understand users and gather data.
- **Data Collection**: Gathering data from reliable sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying patterns and trends.
- **Modeling**: Creating predictive models to forecast preferences in Intellectual Properties trends.
- **Recommendations**: Providing actionable insights based on the analysis.

## Key Highlights

- **Male vs Female**:
  Males are twice as likely to exhibit collecting habits compared to females.

- **The "C" Word (Collector)**:
  Nearly 70% of respondents with collecting habits deny being collectors.

- **Age of IPs**:
  Despite nostalgia not being a claimed factor, 60-70% of respondents prefer IPs older than 5 years.

- **Emotions**:
  Emotional factors drive 70% of the support for favorite IPs.

- **Predictions**:
  Key variables identified to predict collectors with a 59% success rate.
